#Has the exact same trait points as BIOLOGICAL
#BIOLOGICAL2 = {
#	inherit_trait_points_from = BIOLOGICAL

#	robotic: is this archetype's species robotic? Governs various things:
#		- does the species count as robotic (for is_robotic = yes, and various hardcoded checks)
#		- notably can the species grow, or is just assembled?
#	uses_modifiers: should modifiers be generated for this archetype at all?
